## Blog

You will be writing blog posts about your learning in this class. We will be aggregating those blog posts to the CS@Worcester blog [http://cs.worcester.edu/blog/]().

### Create Blog

If you do not already have a blog, create one. There are many places that will let you create a free blog. If you have no preference, I suggest using WordPress [http://wordpress.com]().

Some notes:

1. **Naming your blog**. I suggest that you do not use a name that includes the title or number of this course, or that specifically references Worcester State. This should be a professional blog that you can post to throughout your career. Blogging is the way that many computing professionals record what they have done for their future use, to help others learn how to use new tools and technologies, and act as a professional portfolio. 
2. **Accessibility of your blog.** You need to make your blog publicly accessible. You may blog under a pseudonym if you wish, but you must let me know the name of your blog.
3. **Tagging or Categories.** When you write blog posts, you should tag them based on the topic, or you should create categories to post them under, or both. The difference between tags and categories is unclear, and differs from blogging platform to platform. The reason for tagging your posts is not just to organize them for yourself and others, but also to allow you to syndicate your posts to different sites based on content. I suggest a tag called `CS@Worcester` for posts related to the class so that they can be aggregated to the CS@Worcester blog. (You can get a feel for how this is done by looking at my blog: [http://blog.karl.w-sts.com/]().

### Link to CS Blog

Find the RSS or Atom feed for the tag you have decided on using for the class, and post it as a comment on the How To Contribute To This Blog page on the CS@Worcester blog: [http://cs.worcester.edu/blog/how-to-contribute/](). There are some instructions there for figuring out the feed uri.

### Write Introductory Blog Post

Write a blog post introducing your blog and tag it so that it will appear on the CS@Worcester blog.

## Development Environment Set-up

Sign up for a free student license at [https://www.jetbrains.com/student/]() and download and install IntelliJ IDEA. Start working with it to figure out how to write, build and run a Java project.
