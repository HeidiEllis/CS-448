# Final Presentations

Final presentations for CS 448 will be given on Tuesday, 9 May 2017 --- 8:30-11:30am in ST 107.

## Length of Presentation
* Each team will be expected to present for a minimum of *n* * 5 minutes, where *n* is the number of members of the team. 
* Each member of the team is expected to present for a minimum of 5 minutes.
* Each member's portion of the presentation should be of approximately equal depth and level of technical detail. In other words, no member of the team should be relegated to only introducing the presentation, or other content-light topics.

## Format of Presentation
* Your presentation is expected to be an oral presentation supported by appropriate visual materials:
	* Slides of information about group process, lessons learned, suggestions for future semsters, etc.
	* Screenshots of the changes you made to the application, your scrum board, your repository, JIRA issues and discussion, etc.
	* Sections of code with appropriate commentary on changes made, etc.
	* Diagrams of repository organization, code architecture, etc.
	* Etc.
* You are expected to speak clearly, at a resonable pace, and at a reasonable volume.
* You are expected to speak to and make eye contact with the audience, not speak to the screen, to the floor, to your teammates, or only to the instructor.
* Your presentation may contain comments aimed at improvements to the course for future semesters, but such comments should be less than 20% of the overall presentation. (The appropriate place for lengthy suggestions for improvement is on the anonymous survey that will be posted on Blackboard.)

## Suggestions from Clean Code
* Assign each specific topic to a single team member to present, rather than having multiple team members present a single topic. (The Single Responsibility Principle applies in presentations as well...)
* A specific topic should be covered once, and not come up in multiple parts of the presentation. (The Don't Repeat Yourself rule applies here too...)
* Organize your presentation like a newpaper story - give a high-level overview of your presentation topics first, then cover topics in more depth.
* A slide, like a method, should be short and easy to read, without lots of unnecessary comments. Fill in the details as you speak about the material.
* Keep in mind your audience - use vocabulary that will make sense to them and make your presentation easy to follow.

## Other Suggestions
* You should focus on what you learned, not just talk about what you did.
* Re-read your Learning Reflection Blog Posts for material that you may have forgotten about.
* Practice your presentation in advance so that you:
	*  know what you are going to say
	*  don't speak too quickly or too slowly
	*  can get feedback from your teammates
	*  don't use too much or too little time
* Make sure your slides are readable - in general your text should not be smaller than 20pt, you should not have too much text on one slide. Make sure your slides can be read from the back of the room.
* You should not have more than 1 slide per minute, except for title slides or image slides for which you will not say anything.
