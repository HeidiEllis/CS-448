## Objectives
The objective of this assignment is for students to get themselves set up with some of the tools and websites that they will need for assignments during the semester.

Each of the four tasks below is worth 1 Token. Completing all of them by the appropriate due dates will let you start the semester with 5 Tokens. Other set-up tasks may be assigned as the semester progresses

***Note: All of these tasks will have to be done at some point in the semester anyway to be able to complete a particular assignment in the course. So you might as well do it now, and earn a Token.***

## Task 4: Blog Set-up
### *Worth 1 Token*

### Introduction

You will be writing blog posts about the professionalism readings in the Apprenticeship Patterns book, as well as reflective blog posts about your learning at the end of each multi-week sprint. Your blog must be publicly accessible[^1], and will be aggregated on the [CS@Worcester Blog](http://cs.worcester.edu/blog/).

[^1]: If there is a reason why your name cannot be publicly associated with this course, you may blog under a pseudonym. You must see me to discuss the details, but your blog must still be publicly accessible and aggregated, and you must inform me of your pseudonym.

### Create Blog

If you do not already have your own blog, create one. There are many places that will let you create a free blog. If you have no preference, I suggest using [WordPress](http://wordpress.com).

Some notes:

1. **Naming your blog**. I suggest that you do not use a name that includes the title or number of this course, or that specifically references Worcester State. This should be a professional blog that you can post to throughout your career. Blogging is the way that many computing professionals record what they have done for their future use, to help others learn how to use new tools and technologies, and act as a professional portfolio.
2. **Accessibility of your blog.** You need to make your blog publicly accessible. You may blog under a pseudonym if you wish, but you must let me know the name of your blog.
3. **Tagging or Categories.** When you write blog posts, you should tag them based on the topic, or you should create categories to post them under, or both. The difference between tags and categories is unclear, and differs from blogging platform to platform. The reason for tagging your posts is not just to organize them for yourself and others, but also to allow you to syndicate your posts to different sites  and for different courses, based on content.
    * You must use the tag `CS@Worcester` on your posts for this course, so that they can be aggregated to the CS@Worcester blog. (You can get a feel for how this is done by looking at [my blog](http://blog.karl.w-sts.com/).
    * You  must use the tag `CS-448` on your posts for this course.

### Write Introductory Blog Post

Write a blog post introducing your blog for this course and tag it with `CS@Worcester` and `CS-448`.

This post does not need to be long. All it has to include is information about the course number and the semester. This post is mostly to test that your blog is syndicating correctly to the `CS@Worcester` blog.

### Link to CS Blog

Find the RSS or Atom feed for the `CS@Worcester` tag and post it as a comment on the [How To Contribute To This Blog page on the CS@Worcester blog](http://cs.worcester.edu/blog/how-to-contribute/). There are some instructions there for figuring out the feed URI.

### Deliverable Specification
Your assignment must meet *all* of the following specifications by the due date to earn 1 token:

* A blog post introducing your blog for this course.
* The tag `CS@Worcester` on that post.
* The tag `CS-448` on that post.
* The RSS or Atom feed URI for your `CS@Worcester` tag posted as a comment on [How To Contribute To This Blog page on the CS@Worcester blog](http://cs.worcester.edu/blog/how-to-contribute/).
