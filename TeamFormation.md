### *CS-448 01 --- Software Development Capstone --- Spring 2017*

# Team Formation Process

You will be working in a team of 6 students for the entire semester on your software development project. Since this is a long-term team, it's important that we select teams that will work well together. Rather than the teams being entirely instructor-formed, or randomly assigned, or based on who you know, we are going to select the teams in a more intentional way.

The four teams will each be formed by a student ***Team Recruiter***. The job of the Team Recruiter will be to form their team by reruiting students who they feel will work well together and that have skills that complement each other, based on their prior experience with their classmates.

The Team Recruiters will be elected from the class by a vote of their classmates.

Once the Team Recruiters have been elected, they will choose other students to join their teams.

The students who are being recruited will be allowed to pair with another classmate, and the pairs will be recruited together. This way each student will get to choose at least one person they want to work with for the rest of the semester.

*Note: Team Recruiters will not necessarily be team leaders for the rest of the semester. Their job as Team Recruiter ends once the teams are formed. After that the teams can decide if they need a formally chosen leader, or if they will let the leadership role(s) evolve organically over the semester.*

## Day 1 - Tuesday, 17 January 2017

### Explanation of Team Formation Process

I will explain the Team Formation Process in class and answer any questions the class has.

## Between Day 1 and Day 2

### 1. Applying To Be A Team Recruiter

Anyone in the class can be elected to be a Team Recruiter, simply by receiving enough votes in the election that will take place on Day 2. 

However, those who would like to "apply" for the position, should create a thread on the discussion board in Blackboard listing their qualifications, and answering questions from their classmates.

### 2. Choose a Partner (and Possibly an Alternate)

All students should select a partner that they would like to work with on a team. You should also select an alternate partner (in case you and your partner are both elected to be Team Recruiters.)

## Day 2 - Thursday, 19 January 2017

### 1. Voting for Team Recruiters

1. Select *up to 8* students from the ballot. (All students in the class will be listed on the ballot.) These should be the 8 students you feel you would be in the best position to form a team, because they know the other students in class well enough to form a team that will work well together and has an appropriate mix of skills and abilities.
2. Rank those students from 1 to 8, where 1 is the student you feel would be best at forming a team.

The top four vote-getters (#1, #2, #3, #4) will be selected to form the four teams for the semester[^1]. 

[^1]: Ballots will be counted using [Single Transferrable Vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote#Voting) with a Droop quota of 5 (based on 4 "seats" and 24 voters).

### 2. Initial Picks

1. &num;1 will choose one student for their team (their chosen partner or alternate).
2. &num;2 will choose one student for their team (their chosen partner or alternate).
3. &num;3 will choose one student for their team (their chosen partner or alternate).
4. &num;4 will choose one student for their team (their chosen partner or alternate).

### 3. Final Team Formation

The remaining students will announce their partners before the selection continues.

1. &num;4 will choose a pair for their team.
2. &num;3 will choose a pair for their team.
3. &num;2 will choose a pair for their team.
4. &num;1 will choose a pair for their team.
5. &num;1 will choose a second pair for their team.
6. &num;2 will choose a second pair for their team.
7. &num;3 will choose a second pair for their team.
8. &num;4 will choose a second pair for their team.

## Acknowledgements
The original idea for this team formation method came from suggestions by [Dr. Stoney Jackson](http://mars.wne.edu/~hjackson/). I made modifications so that it is actually workable for the number of students in the course this semester, and to make the picks more fair for each Team Recruiter.
