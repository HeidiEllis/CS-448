## Where Does This Course Lead?
* Your professional career

## Course Workload Expectations
***This is a three-credit project-based course. You should expect to spend, on average, 9 hours per week on this class.***

You will spend 3 hours per week in class participating in Scrum meetings and working with your team. In addition, you should expect to spend, on average, at least 6 hours per week during the semester outside of class, writing code and documentation, learning new tools and techniques, and communicating with the team. (See *Definition of the Credit Hour*)

***The bulk of your work in this course will take place outside of the class time. It is not possible to contribute the amount of work your team and the class need to be successful entirely within the 3 hours of class time. If you attempt to do so, you will not only receive a poor grade in the course, but will also be letting down your classmates, and giving a poor impression of your reliability and quality of work to your classmates and to members of the professional community.***

***This is a chance to build your professional reputation - make sure you make a good impression.***

## Definition of the Credit Hour
>Federal regulation defines a credit hour as an amount of work represented in intended learning outcomes and verified by evidence of student achievement that is an institutional established equivalence that reasonably approximates not less than –

>1.	One hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out of class student work each week for approximately fifteen weeks for one semester or trimester hour of credit, or ten to twelve weeks for one quarter hour of credit, or the equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time; or
2.	At least an equivalent amount of work as required in paragraph (1) of this definition for other academic activities as established by the institution including laboratory work, internships, practica, studio work, and other academic work leading to the award of credit hours.

## Grading Policies
I want everyone receiving a passing grade in this course to be, at least, minimally competent in the course learning outcomes and for that to be reflected in your course grade. Traditional grading schemes do a poor job of indicating competency.

As an example, imagine a course with two major learning outcomes: X and Y. It is widely considered that a course grade of C indicates that a student is minimally competent in achieving the course outcomes. However, if the student were to receive a grade of 100 for outcome X, and a grade of 40 for outcome Y, the student would still have a 70 (C-) average for the course. Yet the student is clearly not competent in outcome Y.

Therefore the grading in this course will be handled in a different manner:

* All assignments will be graded on a ***Meets Specification*** / ***Does Not Yet Meet Specification*** basis, based on whether the student work meets the instructor-supplied specification.
* A minimum collection of assignments, indicating *minimal* competency in the course learning outcomes, must be completed in a ***Meets Specification*** manner to earn a passing course grade (D).
* Higher passing grades (A, B, C) can be earned by completing more assignments and/or assignments that show higher-level thinking and learning skills.

### Assignment Grading

* All assignments in this course will be graded exclusively on a ***Meets Specification*** / ***Does Not Yet Meet Specification*** basis.
* **For each assignment, you will be given a detailed specification explaining what is required for the work to be marked *Meets Specification*.**
* Failing to meet ***any part*** of the specification will result in the work being marked **Does Not Yet Meet Specification**.
* There will be no partial credit given.
* If you are unclear on what the specification requires, it is your responsibility to ask me for clarification.
* It will be possible to revise and resubmit a limited number of assignments with **Does Not Yet Meet Specification** grades (see *Revision and Resubmission of Work* below).

### Course Grade Determination

Your grade for the course will be determined by which assignments and/or how many assignments you complete in an Meets Specification manner.

#### Base Grade

Assignment | Earn<br>Base<br>Grade<br>A | Earn<br>Base<br>Grade<br>B | Earn<br>Base<br>Grade<br>C | Earn<br>Base<br>Grade<br>D
--- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-:
Attendance and Participation (Class Sessions)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; Introduction/Team Formation, Pre-Planning, and Observation&nbsp;(out of 3)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; Sprint Planning&nbsp;(out of 3)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; Sprint Review&nbsp;(out of 3)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; Sprint Retrospective&nbsp;(out of 2)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; Standup Meeting and Work Classes&nbsp;(out of 17) | <br>3<br>3<br>3<br>2<br>16 | <br>3<br>3<br>3<br>2<br>14 | <br>3<br>3<br>3<br>2<br>12 | <br>2<br>3<br>3<br>2<br>10
Sprint Planning Preparation (3 Sprints)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; Team Score (3 pts per Sprint) + Individual Score (3 pts per sprint)  | <br>16 pts | <br>14 pts | <br>10 pts | <br>6 pts
Sprint Review (3 Sprints)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; Team Grade (8 pts per Sprint) | <br>18 pts | <br>16 pts | <br>12 pts | <br>8 pts
Sprint Retrospective &mdash; Individual Blog Post&nbsp;(3 Sprints) | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3
<em>Apprenticeship Patterns</em> Blog Posts<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; Chapter 1 and Chapter 2-6 Introductions<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; Individual <em>Apprenticeship Patterns</em> | <br>&#10004;<br>8 | <br>&#10004;<br>6 | <br>&#10004;<br>4 | <br>&#10004;<br>2
Final Presentation | &#10004; | &#10004; | &#10004; | &#10004;

* **Failing to meet the all the requirements for a particular letter grade will result in not earning that grade.** For example, even if you complete all other requirements for a B grade, but fail to write 6 Individual <em>Apprenticeship Pattern</em> Blog Posts that meet specification, you will earn a C grade.
* **Failing to meet the all the requirements for earning a D grade will result in a failing grade for the course.**

#### Plus or Minus Grade Modifiers

* You will have a ***plus*** modifier applied to your base grade if you complete one more *Individual Apprenticeship Pattern Blog Post* ***and*** attend one more *Standup Meeting and Work Class* than required for a particular base grade.
* You will have a ***minus*** modifier applied to your base grade if you complete one fewer *Individual Apprenticeship Pattern Blog Posts* ***and*** attend one fewer *Standup Meeting and Work Classes* than required for a particular base grade.

*Note:*

* The limits for the number of assignments to be submitted in a single week still apply.
* WSU has no A+ grade.

## Attendance and Participation (In-Class)
You are expected to attend all class meetings. During our class meetings, your team will be planning for upcoming work, updating each other on status, reviewing past work, producing new work, and discussing course material.

For your Attendance and Participation for a particular class to be marked ***Meets Specification*** you are expected to:

* Be present.
* Have arrived on time.
* Participate fully in team activities.

**Each of the four teams will have a slightly different schedule for the types of classes listed below.  See the schedule at the end of this syllabus for details.**

### Introduction, Team Formation, and Observation Classes
For the first two classes, we will be discussing the LibreFoodPantry project and architecture, and forming our teams for the semester. Each team will also have a class where they are expected to observe another team's meeting (but not participate).

### Sprint Planning Classes
The first class of each multi-week sprint will be used for the team to plan the upcoming sprint. This meeting will be facilitated by the team's Scrum Master. The Product Owner (the instructor) will be a participant in this meeting, and will help with the planning.

### Sprint Review Classes
The next-to-last class of each multi-week sprint will be used to review completed work. This meeting will be facilitated by the team's Scrum Master. The Product Owner (the instructor) will be a participant in this meeting, will be the one you are presenting the completed work to, and will make the determination of whether to accept work as "done".

### Sprint Retrospective Classes
The last class of each multi-week sprint will be used to evaluate team performance, and decide on changes to make to team process. This meeting will be facilitated by the team's Scrum Master. The Product Owner (the instructor) will be a participant in this meeting, mostly as an observer.

### Standup Meeting and Work Classes
The classes in the middle of each multi-week sprint will be used to participate in a Standup Meeting to keep your team informed of what you have done, what you plan to do next, and any problems you are having. This meeting will be facilitated by the team's Scrum Master. The Product Owner (the instructor) may observe, depending on what other meetings are happening.

You will also use these classes to work in small groups on planning, development, and learning. In addition, teams will be sending observers to other teams' meetings to bring back information on what other teams are doing. The Product Owner (the instructor) may be available for questions during these classes, depending on what other meetings are happening.

## Sprint Planning Preparation &mdash; Team Score + Individual Score
In the week preceding the Sprint Planning meeting, you will preparing for the planning meeting that takes place in class.

You and your team will be graded on what you have done in the preceding week to help prepare for the planning meeting.

### Team Score
Your team will be assigned a score at the end of the Sprint Planning Meeting that indicates how well the team has planned for the upcoming sprint. This score will be determined by the instructor based on the issues that are placed in the board's To-Do column for the sprint. The following rubric will be used:

Description | Score
--- | ---
Clearly enough work planned for the upcoming sprint | 3 pts
Maybe enough work planned for the upcoming sprint (but not clear) | 2 pts
Clearly not enough work planned for the upcoming sprint | 1 pt
No work planned for the upcoming sprint | 0 pts

### Individual Score
You will be assigned a score after the Sprint Planning Meeting that indicates how well you helped the team prepare for the planning meeting. This score will be determined by the instructor based on the following rubric:

Description | Score
--- | ---
Clearly enough planning activities completed | 3 pts
Maybe enough planning activities completed (but not clear) | 2 pts
Clearly not enough planning activities completed | 1 pt
No planning activities completed | 0 pts

Example activities to complete while preparing for Sprint Planning:
*	Comment on existing issues to help refine them.		
*	Create new issues for missing items.
*	Identify issues that you think should be closed, and explain why.			
*	Ask or answer clarifying questions on an issue.			
*	Suggest a weight for an issue, and explain why.			
*	Suggest that an issue should be in the next sprint and why.			
*	Propose who should do something and explain why.			
*	Document resources useful for completing a task.		
*	Provide a plan, checklist, or list of steps for completing a task.		
*	Apply or remove labels appropriately, and explain why.			
*	Respond to someone else's comment (emojis are acceptable).

## Sprint Review &mdash; Team Score
During and immediately after the Sprint Review meeting, you will be graded ***as a team*** on how much was accomplished during the preceding sprint.

The grading criteria include:
* Demo of the completed sprint work &mdash; up to 2 points
* GitLab is being used effectively to coordinate the team &mdash; up to 3 points
* Sufficient progress was made on the project &mdash; up to 3 points

### Demo of the completed sprint work
Description | Score
--- | ---
Work is available in the project's GitLab space | 1 pt
Work can be demonstrated on the instructor's computer or using LibreFoodPantry infrastructure | 1 pt

### GitLab is being used effectively to coordinate the team	(planning, discussing, documenting, coordinating, etc.)
Description | Score
--- | ---
Clearly good enough | 3 pts
Could be improved | 2 pts
Clearly not good enough | 1 pt
GitLab is not be used at all | 0 pts

Example activities that show the use of GitLab to coordinate the team:
* Move an item on the board.
* Edit issue titles and/or descriptions, and explain why.
*	Comment on existing issues to help refine them.		
*	Create new issues for missing items.
*	Identify issues that you think should be closed, and explain why.			
*	Ask or answer clarifying questions on an issue.			
*	Assign a weight to an issue, and explain why.			
* Assign a deadline to an issue, and explain why.

### Sufficient progress was made on the project
This will be determined by the acceptance criteria cooperatively set with the Product Owner during Sprint Planning. Acceptance criteria can be renegotiated with the Product Owner, with suitable justification, at least one week before the Sprint Review.

Percentage of To-Do Items Completed | Score
--- | ---
&geq; 75% | 3 pts
&geq; 50% | 2 pts
&geq; 25% | 1 pt
&lt; 25% | 0 pts

## Sprint Retrospective &mdash; Individual Blog Posts
At the end of each sprint, you will post a Sprint Retrospective blog post about your learning in the class, the work and work products you are producing, etc. (Details below in the `Blog Posts` section.)

## Blog Posts

You will be required to keep a blog about your part of the project and your experiences in this class, as well as summaries and reflections on the readings. Your blog must be publicly accessible[^1], and will be aggregated on the [CS@Worcester Blog](http://cs.worcester.edu/blog/) and (possibly) the [Teaching Open Source](http://teachingopensource.org/) Planet.

Your blog posts will be about your learning in the class, the work and work products you are producing, the readings, etc.

[^1]: If there is a reason why your name cannot be publicly associated with this course, you may blog under a pseudonym. You must see me to discuss the details, but your blog must still be publicly accessible and aggregated, and you must inform me of your pseudonym.

### Sprint Retrospective Blog Posts
For your Sprint Retrospective Blog Posts to be marked ***Meets Specification*** your blog post is expected to contain:

* Links to evidence of activity on GitLab with one sentence description for each		
* Reflection on what worked well?		
* Reflection on what didn't work well?		
* Reflection on what changes could be made to improve as a team?		
* Reflection on what changes could be made to improve as an individual?		
* A label for the Sprint Number (e.g. Sprint-1). (See the Schedule at the end of this syllabus for sprint numbers.)
* 500-750 words.
* Due before the date and time of the Sprint Retrospective Meeting.

### <em>Apprenticeship Patterns</em> Chapter 1 and Chapter 2-6 Introductions
Everyone must read and post about Chapter 1 of <em>Apprenticeship Patterns: Guidance for the Aspiring Software Craftsman</em> by Dave Hoover and Adewale Oshineye, and the introduction portions of Chapters 2-6.

For your <em>Apprenticeship Patterns</em> Chapter 1 and Chapter 2-6 Introductions Blog Post to be marked ***Meets Specification*** your blog post is expected to contain:

* Your reaction to the reading, not simply a summary of the material. What did you find interesting, useful, thought-provoking about the reading? Has the reading caused you to change your opinion, the way you think about the topic, or how you work? Do you disagree with something in the reading? And why? Which chapters seem most relevant to you?
* 450-600 words.

### Individual <em>Apprenticeship Patterns</em> Blog Posts
Your Individual <em>Apprenticeship Patterns</em> Blog Posts will be about your reflections on the readings in the book <em>Apprenticeship Patterns: Guidance for the Aspiring Software Craftsman</em> by Dave Hoover and Adewale Oshineye.

Each blog post will be written about a *single* pattern from the book. There are [35 patterns in the book](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/apprenticeship-patterns/9780596806842/apa.html) divided among Chapters 2-6. You do not need to read all the patterns, and you do not need to read them in order. You may select whichever patterns interest you.

For your Individual <em>Apprenticeship Patterns</em> Blog Posts to be marked ***Meets Specification*** your blog post is expected to contain:

* A *short* summary of the pattern.
* Your reaction to the pattern. What did you find interesting, useful, thought-provoking about the pattern? Has the pattern caused you to change the way you think about your intended profession, or how you think you will work? Do you disagree with something in the paterns? And why?
* The tag for the week in which the post was made, E.g. Week-1. (See the Schedule at the end of this syllabus for week numbers.)
* 350-450 words.
* I will only accept one blog entry per week. **You cannot wait until the end of the semester and then turn in all of your blog entries.**

## Final Presentation
Final presentations by teams on their work and experience will be given during our scheduled final exam period: **Friday, 8 May 2020 &mdash; 8:30-11:30am**

## Deliverables
All work will be submitted electronically through a variety of tools. The due date and time will be given on the assignment. The submission date and time will be determined by the submission timestamp of the tool used.

**Please do not submit assignments to me via email.** It is difficult for me to keep track of them and I often fail to remember that they are in my mailbox when it comes time to grade the assignment.

## Late Submissions
Late work will not be accepted. (See *Tokens* below.)

## Revision and Resubmission of Work
Because your first attempt at producing acceptable work for a new category of assignment may be difficult due to being unfamiliar with the specification and not having had any feedback yet, you may revise and resubmit ***a single*** assignment in each of the following categories *only*:

* <em>Apprenticeship Patterns</em> Chapter 1 and Chapter 2-6 Introductions Blog Post
* Individual <em>Apprenticeship Pattern</em> Blog Posts
* Sprint Retrospective Blog Posts

## Tokens
Each student will be able to earn up to 5 tokens over the course of the semester. These tokens will be earned by completing simple set-up and housekeeping tasks for the course.

Tokens can be used to:

* Replace class sessions
  * Introduction, Team Formation, and Observation classes &mdash; 1 token per class
  * Sprint Planning classes &mdash; 3 tokens per class
  * Sprint Review classes &mdash;  3 tokens per class
  * Sprint Retrospective classes &mdash; 2 tokens per class
  * Standup Meeting and Work Classes &mdash; 1 token per class
* Turn in an assignment late by 24 hours
* Turn in a second Individual <em>Apprenticeship Pattern</em> Blog Post  in an a single week
* Revise and resubmit an assignment that was marked **Does Not Yet Meet Specification**. Any work to be revised and resubmitted must have been submitted by the original due date.

**Tokens cannot be used for any other purpose and unused tokens remaining at the end of the semester cannot be used to change your final course grade.**

### Token Accounting
* Unused tokens will be kept track of in the Blackboard *My Grades* area.
* Tokens will not be automatically applied. You must explicitly tell me **by email** when you want to use a token, and for which assignment.

## Getting Help
If you are struggling with the material or a project please see me as soon as possible. Often a few minutes of individual attention is all that is needed to get you back on track.

By all means, try to work out the material on your own, but ask for help when you cannot do that in a reasonable amount of time. The longer you wait to ask for help, the harder it will be to catch up.

**Asking for help or coming to see me during office hours is not bothering or annoying me. I am here to help you understand the material and be successful in the course.**

## Contacting Me
You may contact me by email (Karl.Wurst@worcester.edu), telephone (+1-508-929-8728), or see me in my office. My office hours are listed on the schedule on my web page ([http://cs.worcester.edu/kwurst/](http://cs.worcester.edu/kwurst/)) or you may make an appointment for a mutually convenient time.

**If you email me, please include “[CS-448]” in the subject line, so that my email program can correctly file your email and ensure that your message does not get buried in my general mailbox.**

**If you email me from an account other than your Worcester State email, please be sure that your name appears somewhere in the email, so that I know who I am communicating with.**

You may expect that I will get back to you within 24 hours of your email or phone call (with the exception of weekends and holidays), although you will likely hear from me much sooner.

## Code of Conduct/Classroom Civility
All students are expected to adhere to the policies as outlined in the University’s Student Code of Conduct.

## Student Responsibilities
* Contribute to a class atmosphere conducive to learning for everyone by asking/answering questions, participating in class discussions. Don’t just lurk!
* Seek help when necessary
* Start assignments as soon as they are posted.  Do not wait until the due date to seek help/to do the assignments
* Make use of the academic success center (see below)
* Expect to spend at least 9 hours of work per week on classwork.
* Each student is responsible for the contents of the textbook readings, handouts, and homework assignments.

## Accessibility Statement
Worcester State University is committed to providing reasonable academic accommodations for all students with disabilities.  If you have a disability and are concerned about the format or requirements of this course, please meet with me to discuss ways to ensure full participation.  Students must be registered with Student Accessibility Services in order to receive academic accommodations.  Student Accessibility Services is located in the Administration Building, Room 131, and can be reached by phone (508/929-8733 or email (sas@worcester.edu).  Please notify me if you need this syllabus in an alternative format.

## Tutoring Services/Academic Success Center
Tutoring Services are offered through the Academic Success Center (ASC).  The ASC is located on the first floor of the Administration building, A-130.  Tutoring services are provided to students FREE of charge.  Students seeking academic assistance should visit the center as soon as possible or contact the Tutoring Coordinator at 508-929-8139

## The Math Center
The Math Center provides free assistance to students in Mathematics.  It is located on the first floor of the Sullivan Academic Building, S143.

## The Writing Center
The writing center provides free assistance to students in the areas of research and writing.  It is located on the third floor of the Sullivan Academic Building, S306.

## Worcester State Library
Worcester State Library has access to many articles through online databases including J-STOR. In addition many articles and book chapters are available to students through Inter-Library Loan (ILL).  With a little planning, ILL expands your ability to get credible information sources about topics you pursue in your course work.  Finally WSU students are free to use many of the library resources within the consortium. Given all of these resources it is extremely unlikely that you should have to pay for access to individual articles. Please work with the reference librarians to find the appropriate way to access materials you need.  You have already paid for these resources through your fees—please make use of them.

## Academic Conduct
Each student is responsible for the contents of the readings, discussions, class materials, textbook and handouts.

**You should familiarize yourself with Worcester State College’s Academic Honesty policy. The policy outlines what constitutes academic dishonesty, what sanctions may be imposed and the procedure for appealing a decision. The complete Academic Honesty Policy appears at: [http://www.worcester.edu/Academic-Policies/](http://www.worcester.edu/Academic-Policies/)**

**If you have a serious problem that prevents you from finishing an assignment on time, contact me and we'll come up with a solution.**

## Acknowledgements
This course is heavily influenced by ongoing discussions with [Dr. Stoney Jackson](http://mars.wne.edu/~hjackson/) of Western New England University beginning during the Fall 2014 semester (with 64 commuting hours in his car, lunches, attending his CS-390 class, and more) and still continuing... It is also based on materials from the [FOSS2Serve](http://foss2serve.org/index.php/Main_Page)/[Teaching Open Source](http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/Main_Page)/[POSSE](http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/POSSE) community.

## Student Work Retention Policy
It is my policy to securely dispose of student work one calendar year after grades have been submitted for a course.
