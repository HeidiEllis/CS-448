## Where Does This Course Lead?
* Your professional career

## Course Workload Expectations
***This is a three-credit project-based course. You should expect to spend, on average, 9 hours per week on this class.***
 
You will spend 3 hours per week in class participating in Scrum meetings, attending Product Owner meetings, working with your team, or working on training sessions on new tools and techniques. In addition, you should expect to spend, on average, at least 6 hours per week during the semester outside of class, writing code and documentation, learning new tools and techniques, and communicating with the team. (See *Definition of the Credit Hour*)

***The bulk of your work in this course will take place outside of the class time. It is not possible to contribute the amount of work your team and the class need to be successful entirely within the 3 hours of class time. If you attempt to do so, you will not only receive a poor grade in the course, but will also be letting down your classmates, and giving a poor impression of your reliability and quality of work to your classmates and to members of the professional community.***

***This is a chance to build your professional reputation - make sure you make a good impression.***

## Definition of the Credit Hour
>Federal regulation defines a credit hour as an amount of work represented in intended learning outcomes and verified by evidence of student achievement that is an institutional established equivalence that reasonably approximates not less than –

>1.	One hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out of class student work each week for approximately fifteen weeks for one semester or trimester hour of credit, or ten to twelve weeks for one quarter hour of credit, or the equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time; or 
2.	At least an equivalent amount of work as required in paragraph (1) of this definition for other academic activities as established by the institution including laboratory work, internships, practica, studio work, and other academic work leading to the award of credit hours.

>---New England Association of Schools and Colleges, Commission on Institutions of Higher Education, [Policy on Credits and Degrees](http://cihe.neasc.org/downloads/POLICIES/Pp111_PolicyOnCreditsAndDegrees.pdf)

A portion of our class time will be used for me to present some new material on the software development process, tool, group process, or object-oriented design.

## Course Objectives

This course is intended to mimic, as closely as possible, the professional software development team environment. The students will develop a significant software system, employing knowledge gained from courses throughout the program. They will work in groups to manage a project, selecting and following appropriate project management techniques. They will develop the requirements, design, implementation, and quality assurance plan, and analyze the project for professional, social, and ethical issues. 

The students will have to learn new technology and techniques on their own as required for the specific project, showing the importance of continuing professional development. They will have to reflect on their learning and make frequent written and oral status reports on their individual and team progress. They will be encouraged to contribute the results of their learning and their work back to the professional community.

The students will explore and reflect on what it means to be a professional software developer.

## Course-Level Student Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

* Develop a significant software system, employing knowledge gained from courses throughout the program.

## Grading Policies
I want everyone receiving a passing grade in this course to be, at least, minimally competent in the course learning outcomes and for that to be reflected in your course grade. Traditional grading schemes do a poor job of indicating competency.

As an example, imagine a course with two major learning outcomes: X and Y. It is widely considered that a course grade of C indicates that a student is minimally competent in achieving the course outcomes. However, if the student were to receive a grade of 100 for outcome X, and a grade of 40 for outcome Y, the student would still have a 70 (C-) average for the course. Yet the student is clearly not competent in outcome Y.

Therefore the grading in this course will be handled in a different manner:

* All assignments will be graded on a ***Meets Specification*** / ***Does Not Yet Meet Specification*** basis, based on whether the student work meets the instructor-supplied specification. 
* A minimum collection of assignments, indicating competency in the course learning outcomes, must be completed in a ***Meets Specification*** manner to earn a passing course grade (D).
* Higher passing grades (A, B, C) can be earned by completing more assignments and/or assignments that show higher-level thinking and learning skills.

### Assignment Grading

* All assignments in this course will be graded exclusively on a ***Meets Specification*** / ***Does Not Yet Meet Specification*** basis. 
* **For each assignment, you will be given a detailed specification explaining what is required for the work to be marked *Meets Specification*.** 
* Failing to meet ***any part*** of the specification will result in the work being marked **Does Not Yet Meet Specification**. 
* There will be no partial credit given. 
* If you are unclear on what the specification requires, it is your responsibility to ask me for clarification.
* It will be possible to revise and resubmit a limited number of assignments with **Does Not Yet Meet Specification** grades (see *Revision and Resubmission of Work* below).

### Course Grade Determination

Your grade for the course will be determined by which assignments and/or how many assignments you complete in an Meets Specification manner.

#### Base Grade

Assignment | Earn<br>Base<br>Grade<br>A | Earn<br>Base<br>Grade<br>B | Earn<br>Base<br>Grade<br>C | Earn<br>Base<br>Grade<br>D 
--- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-:
CATME Team Formation Survey | &#10004; | &#10004; | &#10004; | &#10004;

Blog Posts<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;<em>Apprenticeship Patterns</em> &mdash; Chapter 1<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Sprint Retrospective&nbsp;(out of 6)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Individual <em>Apprenticeship Patterns</em> | <br>&#10004;<br>6<br>10 | <br>&#10004;<br>6<br>7 | <br>&#10004;<br>6<br>4 | <br>&#10004;<br>5<br>1
Final Presentation | &#10004; | &#10004; | &#10004; | &#10004;

* **Failing to meet the all the requirements for a particular letter grade will result in not earning that grade.** For example, even if you complete all other requirements for a B grade, but fail to write 7 Individual <em>Apprenticeship Pattern</em> Blog Posts that meet specification, you will earn a C grade.
* **Failing to meet the all the requirements for earning a D grade will result in a failing grade for the course.**

#### Plus or Minus Grade Modifiers

* You will have a ***plus*** modifier applied to your base grade if complete one more Individual <em>Apprenticeship Pattern</em> Blog Posts than required for a particular base grade.
* You will have a ***minus*** modifier applied to your base grade if complete one fewer Individual <em>Apprenticeship Pattern</em> Blog Posts than required for a particular base grade.

*Note:*
 
* The limits for the number of assignments to be submitted in a single week still apply.
* WSU has no A+ grade.

## CATME Team Formation Survey
We will be using [CATME SMARTER Teamwork](https://info.catme.org/about/) to form teams and to assess team performance.

Our first use of CATME will be to use the CATME Team-Maker to form teams for the semester based on criteria collected in the Team Formation Survey. 

Everyone must complete the Team Formation Survey by the due date/time.

## CATME Rater Practice
Our main use of CATME will be to evaluate team performance, and use those evaluations to normalize expectations for team participation and to improve team performance.

In order to help teams normalize their expectations for team participation, everyone will take part in the CATME Rater Pratice. In this way, everyone will learn to apply the same ratings for the same behaviors and level of participation.

## Team Tools/Learning Angular Project
In the first few weeks of the semester, we will learn how to use the tools that we will be using to manage the team and the project. We will also need to learn or review the basics or using the Angular framework for web applications.

To do this, each team will build a small Angular web application, using the team tools we will be using for the rest of the semester.

## Attendance and Participation (In-Class)
You are expected to attend all class meetings. During our class meetings, your team will be planning for upcoming work, updating each other on status, reviewing past work, and discussing course material. 

For your Attendance and Participation for a particular class to be marked ***Meets Specification*** you are expected to:

* Be present.
* Have arrived on time.
* Participate fully in team activities.

### Preliminary Classes
For the first five classses, we will be learning team tools and the Angular framework.
### Sprint Planning
The class at the beginning of each two-week sprint will be used for the team to plan the upcoming sprint.
### Sprint Review and Retrospective
The class at the end of each two-week sprint will be used to review completed work, evaluate team performance, and decide on changes to make to team process.
### Work Classes
The two classes in the middle of each two-week sprint will be used as a time for team members to meet in person and work in small groups.

**Remember that you are expected to spend 6 hours a week outside of class time working on your team-assigned tasks for the sprint.**

## Attendance and Participation (Online)
### Standups
On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays during sprints, you are expected to participate in a Standup Meeting to keep your team informed of what you have done, what you plan to do next, and any problems you are having.

These standup meetings will be asynchronous and online. This means that you can give your status report at anytime during the day on which the standup is due. You will give your status report through Slack.
### CATME Team Evaluations
Team performance will be measured by CATME Team Evaluations. These evaluations will be used to improve team performance and functioning.

There will be a CATME Team Evaluation at the end of each sprint, before the Sprint Retrospective, so that the members of the team can incorporate the results of the evaluation into the decisions made during the retrospective.

## Blog Posts

You will be required to keep a blog about your part of the project and your experiences in this class, as well as summaries and reflections on the readings. Your blog must be publicly accessible[^1], and will be aggregated on the [CS@Worcester Blog](http://cs.worcester.edu/blog/) and (possibly) the [Teaching Open Source Planet](http://planet.teachingopensource.org/). 

Your blog posts will be about your learning in the class, the work and work products you are producing, the readings, etc.

[^1]: If there is a reason why your name cannot be publicly associated with this course, you may blog under a pseudonym. You must see me to discuss the details, but your blog must still be publicly accessible and aggregated, and you must inform me of your pseudonym.


### Sprint Retrospective Blog Posts
At the end of each sprint, you will post a Sprint Retrospective blog post about your learning in the class, the work and work products you are producing, etc.

For your Sprint Retrospective Blog Posts to be marked ***Meets Specification*** your blog post is expected to contain:

* A reflection on what you learned from the week's activities, how you would proceed differently in light of this, and how what was learned might be applied in other situations.
* A detailed description of what was done during the week, an explanation of why you took the steps you did during the week. Describes what was tried, what succeeded and what failed, and how you chose the course of action.
* Includes references to where information/help was found. 
* A label for the Sprint Number (e.g. Sprint-1). (See the Schedule at the end of this syllabus for sprint numbers.)
* A list of steps that could be followed by another person to do the same thing (if applicable).
* 500-750 words.

### <em>Apprenticeship Patterns</em> Chapter 1
Everyone must read and post about Chapter 1 of <em>Apprenticeship Patterns: Guidance for the Aspiring Software Craftsman</em> by Dave Hoover and Adewale Oshineye.

For your <em>Apprenticeship Patterns</em> Chapter 1 Blog Post to be marked ***Meets Specification*** your blog post is expected to contain:

* Your reaction to the reading, not simply a summary of the material. What did you find interesting, useful, thought-provoking about the reading? Has the reading caused you to change your opinion, the way you think about the topic, or how you work? Do you disagree with something in the reading? And why?
* 450-600 words.

### Individual <em>Apprenticeship Patterns</em> Blog Posts
Your Individual <em>Apprenticeship Patterns</em> Blog Posts will be about your reflections on the readings in the book <em>Apprenticeship Patterns: Guidance for the Aspiring Software Craftsman</em> by Dave Hoover and Adewale Oshineye.

Each blog post will be written about a *single* pattern from the book. There are [35 patterns in the book](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/apa.html) divided among Chapters 2-6. You do not need to read all the patterns, and you do not need to read them in order. You may select whichever patterns interest you.

For your Individual <em>Apprenticeship Patterns</em> Blog Posts to be marked ***Meets Specification*** your blog post is expected to contain:

* A *short* summary of the pattern.
* Your reaction to the pattern. What did you find interesting, useful, thought-provoking about the pattern? Has the pattern caused you to change the way you think about your intended profession, or how you think you will work? Do you disagree with something in the paterns? And why? 
* The tag for the week in which the post was made, E.g. Week-1. (See the Schedule at the end of this syllabus for week numbers.)
* 350-450 words.
* I will only accept one blog entry per week. **You cannot wait until the end of the semester and then turn in all of your blog entries.** 

## Final Presentation
Final presentations by teams on their work and experience will be given during our scheduled final exam period &mdash; Thursday, 10 May 2018 from 12:30-3:30pm

## Deliverables
All work will be submitted electronically through a variety of tools. The due date and time will be given on the assignment. The submission date and time will be determined by the submission timestamp of the tool used.

**Please do not submit assignments to me via email.** It is difficult for me to keep track of them and I often fail to remember that they are in my mailbox when it comes time to grade the assignment.

## Late Submissions
Late work will not be accepted. (See *Tokens* below.)

## Revision and Resubmission of Work
Because your first attempt at producing acceptable work for a new category of assignment may be difficult due to being unfamiliar with the specification and not having had any feedback yet, you may revise and resubmit ***a single*** assignment in each of the following categories *only*:

* <em>Apprenticeship Patterns</a> Chapter 1 Blog Post
* Individual <em>Apprenticeship Pattern</a> Blog Post
* Sprint Retrospective Blog Post

## Tokens
Each student will be able to earn up to 5 tokens in the first week. These tokens will be earned by completing simple set-up and housekeeping tasks for the course.

Each token can be used to:

* replace a single missed class session (up to a maximum of 3 missed class sessions)
* turn in an assignment late by 24 hours
* turn in a second Individual <em>Apprenticeship Pattern</a> Blog Post  in an a single week
* revise and resubmit an assignment (up to a maximum of 2) that was marked **Does Not Yet Meet Specification**. Any work to be revised and resubmitted must have been submitted by the original due date.
* Tokens cannot be used for any other purpose and unused tokens remaining at the end of the semester cannot be used to change your final course grade.

### Token Accounting
* Unused tokens will be kept track of in the Blackboard *My Grades* area.
* Tokens will not be automatically applied. You must explicitly tell me **by email** when you want to use a token, and for which assignment.

## Getting Help
If you are struggling with the material or a project please see me as soon as possible. Often a few minutes of individual attention is all that is needed to get you back on track.

By all means, try to work out the material on your own, but ask for help when you cannot do that in a reasonable amount of time. The longer you wait to ask for help, the harder it will be to catch up. 

**Asking for help or coming to see me during office hours is not bothering or annoying me. I am here to help you understand the material and be successful in the course.**

## Contacting Me
You may contact me by email (Karl.Wurst@worcester.edu), telephone (+1-508-929-8728), or see me in my office. My office hours are listed on the schedule on my web page ([http://cs.worcester.edu/kwurst/](http://cs.worcester.edu/kwurst/)) or you may make an appointment for a mutually convenient time.

**If you email me, please include “[CS-448]” in the subject line, so that my email program can correctly file your email and ensure that your message does not get buried in my general mailbox.**

**If you email me from an account other than your Worcester State email, please be sure that your name appears somewhere in the email, so that I know who I am communicating with.**

## Worcester State Library
Worcester State Library has access to many articles through online databases including J-STOR. In addition many articles and book chapters are available to students through Inter-Library Loan (ILL).  With a little planning, ILL expands your ability to get credible information sources about topics you pursue in your course work.  Finally WSU students are free to use many of the library resources within the consortium. Given all of these resources it is extremely unlikely that you should have to pay for access to individual articles. Please work with the reference librarians to find the appropriate way to access materials you need.  You have already paid for these resources through your fees—please make use of them.

## Academic Conduct
Each student is responsible for the contents of the readings, discussions, class materials, textbook and handouts. 

**You should familiarize yourself with Worcester State College’s Academic Honesty policy. The policy outlines what constitutes academic dishonesty, what sanctions may be imposed and the procedure for appealing a decision. The complete Academic Honesty Policy appears at: [http://www.worcester.edu/Academic-Policies/](http://www.worcester.edu/Academic-Policies/)**

**If you have a serious problem that prevents you from finishing an assignment on time, contact me and we'll come up with a solution.**

## Acknowledgements
This course is heavily influenced by ongoing discussions with [Dr. Stoney Jackson](http://mars.wne.edu/~hjackson/) of Western New England University beginning during the Fall 2014 semester (with 64 commuting hours in his car, lunches, attending his CS-390 class, and more.) It is also based on materials from the [FOSS2Serve](http://foss2serve.org/index.php/Main_Page)/[Teaching Open Source](http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/Main_Page)/[POSSE](http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/POSSE) community. 

## Student Work Retention Policy
It is my policy to securely dispose of student work one calendar year after grades have been submitted for a course.
