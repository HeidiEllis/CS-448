## Where Does This Course Lead?
* Your professional career

## Course Workload Expectations
***This is a three-credit project-based course. You should expect to spend, on average, 9 hours per week on this class.***
 
You will spend 3 hours per week in class participating in Scrum meetings, attending Product Owner meetings, discussing the readings, or working on training sessions on new tools and techniques. In addition, you should expect to spend, on average, at least 6 hours per week during the semester outside of class, writing code and documentation, learning new tools and techniques, and communicating with the team. (See *Definition of the Credit Hour*)

***The bulk of your work in this course will take place outside of the class time. It is not possible to contribute the amount of work your team and the class need to be successful entirely within the 3 hours of class time. If you attempt to do so, you will not only receive a poor grade in the course, but will also be letting down your classmates, and giving a poor impression of your reliability and quality of work to your classmates and to members of the professional community.***

***This is a chance to build your professional reputation - make sure you make a good impression.***

## Definition of the Credit Hour
>Federal regulation defines a credit hour as an amount of work represented in intended learning outcomes and verified by evidence of student achievement that is an institutional established equivalence that reasonably approximates not less than –

>1.	One hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out of class student work each week for approximately fifteen weeks for one semester or trimester hour of credit, or ten to twelve weeks for one quarter hour of credit, or the equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time; or 
2.	At least an equivalent amount of work as required in paragraph (1) of this definition for other academic activities as established by the institution including laboratory work, internships, practica, studio work, and other academic work leading to the award of credit hours.

Much of our class time will be used for team planning, review, estimation, and task selection and creation work to enable your team to make progress within the project. A portion of our class time will be used for me to present some new material on the software development process, tool, group process, or object-oriented design.

## Course Objectives

This course is intended to mimic, as closely as possible, the professional software development team environment. The students will develop a significant software system, employing knowledge gained from courses throughout the program. They will work in groups to manage a project, selecting and following appropriate project management techniques. They will develop the requirements, design, implementation, and quality assurance plan, and analyze the project for professional, social, and ethical issues. 

The students will have to learn new technology and techniques on their own as required for the specific project, showing the importance of continuing professional development. They will have to reflect on their learning and make frequent written and oral status reports on their individual and team progress. They will be encouraged to contribute the results of their learning and their work back to the professional community.

The students will explore what it means to be a professional software developer.

## Attendance and Participation in Team Status, Planning, Estimation, and Review Meetings

You must attend all class meetings. During our class meetings, your team will be planning for upcoming work, updating each other on status, reviewing past work, and discussing course material. Your attendance and participation in class will be scored as follows:

Score | Description
---|---
2 | Present and Participating
1 | Late or missing a significant portion of class
0 | Absent or not participating
<img src=exempt.png> | Excused Absence*

*An excused absence is determined by the instructor. Ideally, it will be arranged in advance. Otherwise, the instructor must be notified of the absence and the reason as soon as possible, preferrably by the end of the day. The excused absence will not count for or against your Attendance and Participation grade - instead the Attendance and Participation grade will be calculated out of one fewer class meetings.


## Peer Reviews

Teamwork will be evaluated by peer review. Below are the characteristics that will be used to assess teamwork. At the end of each sprint, each team member will evaluate each other team member in the following areas using a 3 point scale.

### Areas
* Attendance
    * Makes all meetings
    * Is on time for meetings
    * Participates in meetings
* Communication
    * Timely
    * Clear
    * Professional
* Cooperation
    * Willingness to help others
    * Asks for help when needed
    * Willingness to receive help
* Dependability
    * Takes on responsibilities
    * Meets responsibilities
* Enthusiasm
    * Good attitude
    * Encouraging to others

### Scale
Points | Description
--- | ---
3 | Excellent
2 | Acceptable
1 | Needs improvement

### Improvement plans

If a team member receives an average of less than 2 in any area, the
instructor will review the evaluation with the team. At the instructor's
discretion, the instructor will help the team to create an improvement
plan. The purpose of the plan is to create a support system to help the
team member improve their ratings in the future.

The first time an improvement plan is necessary, no penalty is incurred.
Each subsequent time an improvement plan is necessary, the peer review
score for the team member who needs improvement is as shown in the
following table.

Condition | Category score
--- | ---  
First improvement plan |    100%
Second improvement plan |  85%
Third improvement plan |   70%
Fourth improvement plan |  0%


## Blog Entries with Reflections on Learning and Work Products
You will be required to keep a blog about your part of the project and your experiences in this class. Your blog must be publicly accessible[^1], and will be aggregated on the [CS@Worcester Blog](http://cs.worcester.edu/blog/) and the [Teaching Open Source Planet](http://planet.teachingopensource.org/). 

Your blog entries will be about your learning in the class, the work and work products you are producing, reflections on the readings, etc.

[^1]: If there is a reason why your name cannot be publicly associated with this course, you may blog under a pseudonym. You must see me to discuss the details, but your blog must still be publicly accessible and aggregated, and you must inform me of your pseudonym.

## Final Presentation
Final presentations by teams will be given during our scheduled final exam period – Friday, 9 May 2017 from 8:30am-11:30am

## Deliverables
All work will be submitted electronically through a variety of tools. The due date and time will be given on the assignment. The submission date and time will be determined by the submission timestamp of the tool used.

**Please do not submit assignments to me via email.** It is difficult for me to keep track of them and I often fail to remember that they are in my mailbox when it comes time to grade the assignment.

## Late Submissions
Late assignments will lose 10% of the maximum points per 24-hour period.

***More importantly, your fellow teammates will be relying on you to complete your assigned tasks in a timely fashion, so that they can complete their own. You should be behaving professionally, living up to the group’s expectations and enabling others to do the same.***

## Getting Help
If you are struggling with the material or a project please see me as soon as possible. Often a few minutes of individual attention is all that is needed to get you back on track.

By all means, try to work out the material on your own, but ask for help when you cannot do that in a reasonable amount of time. The longer you wait to ask for help, the harder it will be to catch up. 

I am here to help you understand the material and be successful in the course.

## Contacting Me
You may contact me by email (Karl.Wurst@worcester.edu), telephone (+1-508-929-8728), or see me in my office. My office hours are listed on the schedule on my web page ([http://cs.worcester.edu/kwurst/]()) or you may make an appointment for a mutually convenient time.

**If you email me, please include “[CS-448]” in the subject line, so that my email program can correctly file your email and ensure that your message does not get buried in my general mailbox.**

**If you email me from an account other than your Worcester State email, please be sure that your name appears somewhere in the email, so that I know who I am communicating with.** 

<img src=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive/phd042215s.gif><br><a href=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics.php?f=1795>http://www.phdcomics.com/comics.php?f=1795</a>

You may expect that I will get back to you within 24 hours of your email or phone call (with the exception of weekends and holidays), although you will likely hear from me much sooner.

## Code of Conduct/Classroom Civility
All students are expected to adhere to the policies as outlined in the University’s Student Code of Conduct.

## Student Responsibilities 
* Contribute to a class atmosphere conducive to learning for everyone by asking/answering questions, participating in class discussions. Don’t just lurk!
* Seek help when necessary
* Start assignments as soon as they are posted.  Do not wait until the due date to seek help/to do the assignments
* Make use of the academic success center (see below)
* Expect to spend at least 9 hours of work per week on classwork.
* Each student is responsible for the contents of the textbook readings, handouts, and homework assignments.

## Americans with Disabilities Act
Worcester State University and this instructor are committed to the full participation of all students, and will provide accommodations for any student with documented disabilities who are registered with the Disability Services Office (DSO). Please contact the instructor as early as possible to discuss necessary accommodations. All information regarding disabilities will be treated with confidentiality. The DSO is located in the Administration Building, Room 131 and can be reached by phone (508-929-8733) or email (dso@worcester.edu).  

## Tutoring Services/Academic Success Center
Tutoring Services are offered through the Academic Success Center (ASC).  The ASC is located on the first floor of the Administration building, A-130.  Tutoring services are provided to students FREE of charge.  Students seeking academic assistance should visit the center as soon as possible or contact the Tutoring Coordinator at 508-929-8139

## The Writing Center
The writing center provides free assistance to students in the areas of research and writing.  It is located on the third floor of the Sullivan Academic Building, S306.  To schedule an appointment, please call 508-929-8112 or email the Center at writingcenter@worcester.edu.  To find out more information about the Writing Center including the Center’s hours and the Center’s Online Writing Lab, visit their website at [www.worcester.edu/writing]()

## Worcester State Library
Worcester State Library has access to many articles through online databases including J-STOR. In addition many articles and book chapters are available to students through Inter-Library Loan (ILL).  With a little planning, ILL expands your ability to get credible information sources about topics you pursue in your course work.  Finally WSU students are free to use many of the library resources within the consortium. Given all of these resources it is extremely unlikely that you should have to pay for access to individual articles. Please work with the reference librarians to find the appropriate way to access materials you need.  You have already paid for these resources through your fees—please make use of them.

## Academic Conduct
Each student is responsible for the contents of the readings, discussions, class materials, textbook and handouts. 

**You should familiarize yourself with Worcester State College’s Academic Honesty policy. The policy outlines what constitutes academic dishonesty, what sanctions may be imposed and the procedure for appealing a decision. The complete Academic Honesty Policy appears at: [http://worcester.edu/Academics/Shared%20Documents/AcademicHonesty.aspx]()**

**If you have a serious problem that prevents you from finishing an assignment on time, contact me and we'll come up with a solution.**
