### Rubric for Blog Posts on Professionalism Readings
Your blog posts will be about your reflections on the readings in the two books *The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers* by Robert C. Martin, and 
*The Software Craftsman: Professionalism, Pragmatism, Pride* by Sandro Mancuso. You will read two chapters a week and write a single, relatively short blog post about those chapters. 

The posts are intended to be your reaction to the readings, not simply a summary of the material. What did you find interesting, useful, thought-provoking about the readings? Have the readings caused you to change your opinion, the way you think about the topic, or how you work? Do you disagree with something in the reading? And why?

These blog posts will be scored as follows:

Good (3) | Needs Improvement (2) | Inadequate (1) | Missing (0)
---|---|---|---|---

The comments are backed up by personal reflections on the material including how the material affected the student and why. *Post is labeled with the book title and chapter numbers., e.g. The Clean Coder, Chapters 1 & 2.* | Blog post contains a *short* summary of the assigned chapters and a comment about the material, but the comment is not backed up by any personal reflection on the material. *Post is labeled with the book title and chapter numbers., e.g. The Clean Coder, Chapters 1 & 2.* | Blog post contains only a summary of the assigned chapters for the week. *Post is labeled with the book title and chapter numbers., e.g. The Clean Coder, Chapters 1 & 2.* | No blog post posted for the assigned chapters for the week, *or is not labeled with the book title and chapter numbers.*
